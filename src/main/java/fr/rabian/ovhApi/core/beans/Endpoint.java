/**
 * This class represents an endpoint for the OVH API.
 * The OVH API system is used (of course) in OVH Europe, but also in OVH Canada, So You Start (EU and CA), Kimsufi (EU and CA), and Runabove.
 * Depending on which system you plan to use the wrapper, you should pick your endpoint accordingly.
 * The current (10/04/2015) known endpoints are already defined as class constants, but you can also create your own to suit your needs.
